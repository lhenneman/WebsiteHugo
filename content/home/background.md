Our world is changing all the time. Some change is fast, some change is slow, and all change looks different in across the world. One thing about this change is certain, however---it can all be used to learn more about our environment and our health.

I'm most interested in changes in our air quality, which causes millions of deaths each year world-wide. Many countries have instituted regulations to curb this burden, which we can study using the Accountability Chain.

![Accountability Chain](/img/AccountabilityChain.png)

This framework describes how regulations impact emissions, air quality, personal dose/exposure, and ultimately public health. Though we can make measurements at each of these links, the relationships that most inform policy (blue portions of the arrows) are clouded by other factors (red portions). 

I'm building a multi-disciplenary team that will advance research along the Accountability Chain. We'll build and evaluate models and devise new analytical techniques to create evidence for continued improvements in envornmental policy across various scales, from local to global. If you're a prospective graduate student with strong analytical skills, please review my [ongoing projects](https://www.lucashenneman.org/#projects) and [recent papers](https://www.lucashenneman.org/#publications) and reach out.
